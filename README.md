# üåå StarWing 3D ‚Äî Practice 2 MiV (2024-25)

This project was developed for **Practice 2 of the "Modeling and Visualization" course (MiV)** during the 2024-25 academic year. The main goal is to **build an interactive 3D level** inspired by the classic *Star Wing* (a.k.a. *Star Fox*) game for the Super Nintendo, using **OpenGL for Android devices**.

## üéØ Objectives

- Visually represent a basic 3D scene.
- Enable player interaction with the environment.
- Implement a graphical user interface (HUD) displaying player stats.
- Include extra graphical elements to enhance immersion.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Features

- **.obj model loading**: at least one object (e.g., enemies, scenery, gates) is loaded from an external file.
- **3D lighting**: includes global lighting (with optional spot lighting such as a spaceship headlamp).
- **2D HUD**: showing player data (lives, shield, bombs), optionally animated.
- **Camera control**:
  - Supports movement and rotation to follow gameplay.
  - Switch between first-person and overview (watchtower) view.
- **Animated 3D elements**: such as moving gates or flying enemies.
- **Visual and thematic design** inspired by *Star Wing*.

## üß™ Extra Features (if any)

> Add here any additional features you implemented: particle effects, background music, menus, transitions, etc.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Requirements

- Android Studio
- Android device or emulator supporting OpenGL ES 2.0+

## üì¶ Submission

The project is submitted as a `.zip` file containing:
- Full Java source code (Android Studio project)
- A demo video showcasing all required features and any additional ones
